<h3>Rules:</h3>
<p>Each game has 4 players. Each player will end up with 16 schools on their team. 1 school from every seed line (one #1 seed, one #2 seed, one #3 seed, etc.)</p>
<p>Each time one of your schools wins a game your team recieves points. </p>
<p>The team with the most points after the championship games is the winner</p>
<br>
<h5>Draft:</h5>
<p>You will rank each of the 4 teams per seed line (there are 4 #1 seeds, 4 #2 seeds ,etc) in order of the ones you want to have on your team</p>
<p>If you rank a school #1 on the seed line and nobody else does than you get that school added to your team</p>
<p>You will also designate 4 seed lines as 'priorty' and 2 'super priority'. This mean you will win a tie breaker against anyone who has a lower prioity level for that seed line</p>
<p>If there is still a tie then it will be randomly choosen</p>
