<h5>Game rules:</h5>
<ul>
  <li>Each game has 4 players</li>
  <li>Each player will have 16 schools assigned to their 'team'. 1 school from every seed line (#1 seed, #2 seed, #3 seed, etc.)</li>
  <li>Each time one of your schools wins a game your team recieve one point</li>
  <li>The team with the most points after the championship games is the winner</li>
</ul>

<h5>Ranking schools:</h5>
<ul>
  <li>You will rank each of the 4 teams per seed line (64 teams in total) from 1-4 in the order of the ones you want to have on your team</li>
  <li>You will also designate 4 seed lines as your 'priorty' and 2 as your 'super priority'</li>
</ul>

<h5>School selection:</h5>
<ul>
  <li>Once all the players have ranked all 64 schools, your team will be selected automatically based on each players rankings</li>
  <li>For example, if you rank a school '1' and no other player does, than that school is added to your 'team'</li>
  <li>If multiple players ranked the school '1', then whoever selected the highest priority level will get the school</li>
  <li>If there is still a tie after accounting for priority levels, the school will be selected at ramdom</li>
<ul>
